# 🌱 Smart Agricultural Production Optimization Engine (OptiCrop)

## 📖 Project Overview

The **Smart Agricultural Production Optimization Engine (OptiCrop)** is a Machine Learning-based web application developed to help farmers identify the most suitable crop based on soil nutrients and environmental conditions. The system analyzes important agricultural parameters such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), temperature, humidity, soil pH, and rainfall to recommend the best crop for maximum productivity.

The project aims to improve agricultural decision-making by providing intelligent, data-driven crop recommendations that enhance crop yield, optimize resource utilization, and support sustainable farming practices.

## ⚙ Installation

### Clone the Repository

### Navigate to the Project Folder

```bash
cd OptiCrop
```

### Installing Required Libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
## ▶ Running the Application

Start the Flask server:

```bash
python app.py
```
## 🧪 How It Works

1. The user enters soil and environmental parameters.
2. The application validates the input values.
3. The data is standardized using the trained scaler.
4. The Machine Learning model predicts the most suitable crop.
5. The predicted crop is displayed on the screen.
